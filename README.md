# Weather-CLI-APP
Personal Project #1
Hello!
This is my first project built from scratch. It's basic weather app in CLI. It uses API to get data about weather. User provides city which he is interested in and get somewhat accurate information about current weather and he may choose to get forecast for the next 10 days. If someone see this I would be really thankful for any advice how to improve this mini project. I was thinking about adding GUI to this but I don't think I have enough knowledge to do this.
